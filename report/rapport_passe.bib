  abstract = {A model, GEMAC, glass eel model to assess compliance (GEMAC), has been developed with the objective of assessing anthropogenic impacts on glass eels in estuaries and evaluating the effects of management measures, to support initiatives aimed at helping the eel stocks recover. The model is described and applied to two estuaries with contrasting anthropogenic pressures: the Vilaine and the Garonne. It assesses the proportion of settled glass eels relative to a non-impacted situation with current (\%S/R) or pristine recruitment (\%S/R0). The estimated \%S/R (\%S/R0) is 5.5\% (1.1\%) for the Vilaine and 78\% (19\%) for the Garonne, in accord with the different levels of anthropogenic pressure in these two estuaries. A sensitivity analysis shows that the assessment of \%S/R is accurate, and that in a data-poor context, the \%S/R is under-assessed, as required by the precautionary approach. Seven management scenarios are explored all aiming to halve the anthropogenic pressure, but in fact leading to different levels of glass eel escapement, from almost zero to a 13-fold increase. This variation emphasizes the need for the estuarine context of eel stock management to be carefully evaluated for effectiveness when implementing management measures.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have documented a change in the phenology of migration of diadromous fish in response to climate change. Only few studies have, however, been conducted simultaneously for multiple species and at a large spatial scale. We investigated the change in the timing of upstream migration of diadromous fish species in France. We used an original dataset collected from 40 fish-counting devices in 28 French rivers over 10{\textendash}30 years for five diadromous taxa: Alosa spp., Anguilla anguilla (with a distinction between glass eel and yellow eel), Petromyzon marinus, Salmo salar, and Salmo trutta. Except for glass eel, we found that taxa shifted their migration for earlier arrival dates. This result is consistent with numerous studies reporting advancement of the phenology of species life-events. On average, we highlighted a phenological change of -2.3 days per decade (min = -0.2, max = -3.7). Moreover, the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, sea surface temperature, air temperature, and river discharge were found to explain the timing of upstream migration of diadromous fish taxa, highlighting the importance of factors acting at different spatial scales. Given the important phenological changes observed in our study and more widely in the scientific literature, we recommend that managers incorporate these changes into the management rules; in particular, in the case of dams whose migratory transparency (i.e. the possibility for the fishes to cross the dam) is ensured by adaptive water management and gate operations. This study benefited from large-scale monitoring of migratory phenology of multiple species and environmental variables. These monitoring data are valuable and could allow better predictive modelling of the response of species to climate change.},

It includes methods for (i) estimating biological stock characteristics such as growth and mortality parameters, (ii) exploring technical aspects of the fisheries (e.g. exploitation rate and selectivity characteristics), (iii) assessing size and composition of a fish stock by means of virtual population analysis (VPA), and (iv) assessing stock status with yield prediction and production models. This paper introduces the package and demonstrates the functionality of a selection of its core methods. TropFishR modernises traditional stock assessment methods by easing application and development and by combining it with advanced statistical approaches.},

  abstract = {A general method for constructing low-rank tensor product smooths for use as components of generalized additive models or generalized additive mixed models is presented. A penalized regression approach is adopted in which tensor product smooths of several variables are constructed from smooths of each variable separately, these "marginal" smooths being represented using a low-rank basis with an associated quadratic wiggliness penalty. The smooths offer several advantages: (i) they have one wiggliness penalty per covariate and are hence invariant to linear rescaling of covariates, making them useful when there is no "natural" way to scale covariates relative to each other; (ii) they have a useful tuneable range of smoothness, unlike single-penalty tensor product smooths that are scale invariant; (iii) the relatively low rank of the smooths means that they are computationally efficient; (iv) the penalties on the smooths are easily interpretable in terms of function shape; (v) the smooths can be generated completely automatically from any marginal smoothing bases and associated quadratic penalties, giving the modeler considerable flexibility to choose the basis penalty combination most appropriate to each modeling task; and (vi) the smooths can easily be written as components of a standard linear or generalized linear mixed model, allowing them to be used as components of the rich family of such models implemented in standard software, and to take advantage of the efficient and stable computational methods that have been developed for such models. A small simulation study shows that the methods can compare favorably with recently developed smoothing spline ANOVA methods.},
